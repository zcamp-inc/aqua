This is not a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, don't run the production server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500) with your browser to see the result.
*** PS: I changed the ports to 5500 ***


## Don't Learn More, Trust me

take a look at the following resources, I don't care:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Deploy on Vercel... Heroku is Dead to me

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
